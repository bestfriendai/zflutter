## Proposed Upgrade Strategy

1.  **Run `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`:** This will upgrade all the packages to their latest compatible versions.
2.  **Address Breaking Changes:** After upgrading, the project might have some compilation errors due to breaking changes in the updated packages. These errors need to be fixed by following the migration guides of the respective packages.
3.  **Thorough Testing:** Once the project compiles successfully, it needs to be tested thoroughly to ensure that all the features are working as expected. This includes UI testing, functional testing, and integration testing.
4. **Update `UPGRADE_PLAN.md`:** After successful testing, update this document to reflect the new versions of the packages.

## Conclusion and Final Recommendations

The dependency upgrade process was successful. The application builds without any compilation errors. However, to ensure the stability and correctness of the application, I strongly recommend performing a full regression test. This includes:

*   **Manual Testing:** Manually test all the features of the application, including user authentication, video playback, posting, commenting, and all other functionalities.
*   **UI/UX Testing:** Verify that there are no visual glitches or usability issues.

Once the manual testing is complete and all issues (if any) are resolved, the upgrade can be considered complete. After that, the final step is to commit the changes to the git repository.
